Problem:

Table: subscription_events

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    | 
+------------------+---------+
| event_id         | int     |
| user_id          | int     |
| event_date       | date    |
| event_type       | varchar |
| plan_name        | varchar |
| monthly_amount   | decimal |
+------------------+---------+
event_id is the unique identifier for this table.
event_type can be start, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel.
plan_name can be basic, standard, premium, or NULL (when event_type is cancel).
monthly_amount represents the monthly subscription cost after this event.
For cancel events, monthly_amount is 0.
Write a solution to Find Churn Risk Customers - users who show warning signs before churning. A user is considered churn risk customer if they meet ALL the following criteria:

Currently have an active subscription (their last event is not cancel).
Have performed at least one downgrade in their subscription history.
Their current plan revenue is less than 50% of their historical maximum plan revenue.
Have been a subscriber for at least 60 days.
Return the result table ordered by days_as_subscriber in descending order, then by user_id in ascending order.

Solution:

WITH UserStats AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        MIN(event_date) AS start_date,
        MAX(event_date) AS last_date,
        MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 'cancel' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_cancel,
        MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 'downgrade' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_downgrade,
        MAX(monthly_amount) AS max_historical_amount,
        SUBSTRING_INDEX(
            GROUP_CONCAT(plan_name ORDER BY event_date DESC), ',', 1
        ) AS current_plan,
        SUBSTRING_INDEX(
            GROUP_CONCAT(monthly_amount ORDER BY event_date DESC), ',', 1
        ) AS current_monthly_amount
    FROM subscription_events
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
    user_id,
    current_plan,
    CAST(current_monthly_amount AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS current_monthly_amount,
    max_historical_amount,
    DATEDIFF(last_date, start_date) AS days_as_subscriber
FROM UserStats
WHERE has_cancel = 0
  AND has_downgrade = 1
  AND current_monthly_amount < 0.5 * max_historical_amount
  AND DATEDIFF(last_date, start_date) >= 60
ORDER BY days_as_subscriber DESC, user_id ASC;
