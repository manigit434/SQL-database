Problem:
Table: Stadium

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
As the id increases, the date increases as well.
 

Write a solution to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

Solution:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH GroupedData AS (
    SELECT 
        *, 
    
        id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
    FROM Stadium
    WHERE people >= 100
)
SELECT id, visit_date, people
FROM GroupedData
WHERE grp IN (

    SELECT grp 
    FROM GroupedData 
    GROUP BY grp 
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
)
ORDER BY visit_date;
