Problem:

Table: customer_transactions

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    | 
+------------------+---------+
| transaction_id   | int     |
| customer_id      | int     |
| transaction_date | date    |
| amount           | decimal |
| transaction_type | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
transaction_id is the unique identifier for this table.
transaction_type can be either 'purchase' or 'refund'.
Write a solution to find loyal customers. A customer is considered loyal if they meet ALL the following criteria:

Made at least 3 purchase transactions.
Have been active for at least 30 days.
Their refund rate is less than 20% .
Refund rate is the proportion of transactions that are refunds, calculated as the number of refund transactions divided by the total number of transactions (purchases plus refunds).
Return the result table ordered by customer_id in ascending order.

Solution:
WITH Stats AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count,
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'refund' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS refund_count,
        COUNT(*) AS total_count,
        DATEDIFF(MAX(transaction_date), MIN(transaction_date)) AS active_days
    FROM customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id
FROM Stats
WHERE purchase_count >= 3
  AND active_days >= 30
  AND (refund_count * 1.0 / total_count) < 0.20
ORDER BY customer_id;
