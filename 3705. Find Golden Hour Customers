Problem:

Table: restaurant_orders

+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     | 
+------------------+----------+
| order_id         | int      |
| customer_id      | int      |
| order_timestamp  | datetime |
| order_amount     | decimal  |
| payment_method   | varchar  |
| order_rating     | int      |
+------------------+----------+
order_id is the unique identifier for this table.
payment_method can be cash, card, or app.
order_rating is between 1 and 5, where 5 is the best (NULL if not rated).
order_timestamp contains both date and time information.
Write a solution to find golden hour customers - customers who consistently order during peak hours and provide high satisfaction. A customer is a golden hour customer if they meet ALL the following criteria:

Made at least 3 orders.
At least 60% of their orders are during peak hours (11:00-14:00 or 18:00-21:00).
Their average rating for rated orders is at least 4.0, round it to 2 decimal places.
Have rated at least 50% of their orders.
Return the result table ordered by average_rating in descending order, then by customer_id​​​​​​​ in descending order.

Solution:

WITH Stats AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
        SUM(CASE 
              WHEN (HOUR(order_timestamp) BETWEEN 11 AND 13) 
                OR (HOUR(order_timestamp) = 14 AND MINUTE(order_timestamp) = 0)
                OR (HOUR(order_timestamp) BETWEEN 18 AND 20) 
                OR (HOUR(order_timestamp) = 21 AND MINUTE(order_timestamp) = 0)
              THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS peak_orders,
        SUM(CASE WHEN order_rating IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS rated_orders,
        AVG(CASE WHEN order_rating IS NOT NULL THEN order_rating END) AS avg_rating
    FROM restaurant_orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    total_orders,
    ROUND(peak_orders * 100.0 / total_orders, 0) AS peak_hour_percentage,
    ROUND(avg_rating, 2) AS average_rating
FROM Stats
WHERE total_orders >= 3
  AND (peak_orders * 1.0 / total_orders) >= 0.60
  AND (rated_orders * 1.0 / total_orders) >= 0.50
  AND avg_rating >= 4.0
ORDER BY average_rating DESC, customer_id DESC;
