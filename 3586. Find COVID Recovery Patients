Problem:
Table: patients

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| patient_id  | int     |
| patient_name| varchar |
| age         | int     |
+-------------+---------+
patient_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a patient.
Table: covid_tests

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| test_id     | int     |
| patient_id  | int     |
| test_date   | date    |
| result      | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
test_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a COVID test result. The result can be Positive, Negative, or Inconclusive.
Write a solution to find patients who have recovered from COVID - patients who tested positive but later tested negative.

A patient is considered recovered if they have at least one Positive test followed by at least one Negative test on a later date
Calculate the recovery time in days as the difference between the first positive test and the first negative test after that positive test
Only include patients who have both positive and negative test results
Return the result table ordered by recovery_time in ascending order, then by patient_name in ascending order.


Solution:

WITH first_positive AS (
    SELECT
        patient_id,
        MIN(test_date) AS first_positive_date
    FROM covid_tests
    WHERE result = 'Positive'
    GROUP BY patient_id
),
first_negative_after_positive AS (
    SELECT
        ct.patient_id,
        MIN(ct.test_date) AS first_negative_date
    FROM covid_tests ct
    JOIN first_positive fp
        ON ct.patient_id = fp.patient_id
       AND ct.test_date > fp.first_positive_date
    WHERE ct.result = 'Negative'
    GROUP BY ct.patient_id
)
SELECT
    p.patient_id,
    p.patient_name,
    p.age,
    DATEDIFF(fn.first_negative_date, fp.first_positive_date) AS recovery_time
FROM first_positive fp
JOIN first_negative_after_positive fn
    ON fp.patient_id = fn.patient_id
JOIN patients p
    ON p.patient_id = fp.patient_id
ORDER BY recovery_time ASC, p.patient_name ASC;
