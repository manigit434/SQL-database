Problem:
Table:  logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| log_id      | int     |
| ip          | varchar |
| status_code | int     |
+-------------+---------+
log_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains server access log information including IP address and HTTP status code.
Write a solution to find invalid IP addresses. An IPv4 address is invalid if it meets any of these conditions:

Contains numbers greater than 255 in any octet
Has leading zeros in any octet (like 01.02.03.04)
Has less or more than 4 octets
Return the result table ordered by invalid_count, ip in descending order respectively. 

Solution:
SELECT 
    ip, 
    COUNT(*) AS invalid_count
FROM 
    logs
WHERE 
    -- Filter for IPs that DO NOT match the valid IPv4 pattern
    ip NOT REGEXP '^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])\\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])$'
GROUP BY 
    ip
ORDER BY 
    invalid_count DESC, 
    ip DESC;
