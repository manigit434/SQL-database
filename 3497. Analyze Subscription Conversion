Problem:

Table: UserActivity

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    | 
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| activity_date    | date    |
| activity_type    | varchar |
| activity_duration| int     |
+------------------+---------+
(user_id, activity_date, activity_type) is the unique key for this table.
activity_type is one of ('free_trial', 'paid', 'cancelled').
activity_duration is the number of minutes the user spent on the platform that day.
Each row represents a user's activity on a specific date.
A subscription service wants to analyze user behavior patterns. The company offers a 7-day free trial, after which users can subscribe to a paid plan or cancel. Write a solution to:

Find users who converted from free trial to paid subscription
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their free trial period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their paid subscription period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

Solution:
SELECT 
    user_id,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'free_trial' THEN activity_duration END), 2) AS trial_avg_duration,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'paid' THEN activity_duration END), 2) AS paid_avg_duration
FROM UserActivity
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING 
    -- Ensure user has both activity types (conversion)
    SUM(activity_type = 'free_trial') > 0 
    AND SUM(activity_type = 'paid') > 0
ORDER BY user_id ASC;
