Problem:
Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
Initially, all products have price 10.

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on the date 2019-08-16.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution:
SELECT p.product_id,
       COALESCE(
           (SELECT pr.new_price
            FROM Products pr
            WHERE pr.product_id = p.product_id
              AND pr.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
            ORDER BY pr.change_date DESC
            LIMIT 1),
           10
       ) AS price
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) p;
