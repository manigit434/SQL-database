Problem:
 
Table: Samples

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    | 
+----------------+---------+
| sample_id      | int     |
| dna_sequence   | varchar |
| species        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
sample_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains a DNA sequence represented as a string of characters (A, T, G, C) and the species it was collected from.
Biologists are studying basic patterns in DNA sequences. Write a solution to identify sample_id with the following patterns:

Sequences that start with ATG (a common start codon)
Sequences that end with either TAA, TAG, or TGA (stop codons)
Sequences containing the motif ATAT (a simple repeated pattern)
Sequences that have at least 3 consecutive G (like GGG or GGGG)
Return the result table ordered by sample_id in ascending order.

Solution:
SELECT 
    sample_id, 
    dna_sequence, 
    species,
    -- Starts with ATG
    CASE WHEN dna_sequence LIKE 'ATG%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS has_start,
    -- Ends with TAA, TAG, or TGA
    CASE WHEN dna_sequence LIKE '%TAA' 
           OR dna_sequence LIKE '%TAG' 
           OR dna_sequence LIKE '%TGA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS has_stop,
    -- Contains ATAT
    CASE WHEN dna_sequence LIKE '%ATAT%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS has_atat,
    -- Contains at least 3 consecutive Gs
    CASE WHEN dna_sequence LIKE '%GGG%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS has_ggg
FROM Samples
ORDER BY sample_id ASC;
